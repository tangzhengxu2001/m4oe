# Dynamic Modeling of Patients, Modalities, and Tasks via Multi-modal Multi-task Mixture of Experts

This repository contains the code implementation for the ICLR 2025 poster titled **"Dynamic Modeling of Patients, Modalities and Tasks via Multi-modal Multi-task Mixture of Experts."** Our work sits at the intersection of artificial intelligence and medicine, aiming to advance the state-of-the-art in medical imaging and patient-specific modeling.

## Overview

In this project, we introduce a multi-modal, multi-task mixture of experts framework designed for dynamic modeling across various medical domains. The current release focuses on the Mammography domain and includes:

- **Model Implementation:** A custom Vision Transformer-based architecture with a Mixture-of-Experts design.
- **Datasets:** Code for dataset processing, including preprocessing and train-test split CSV generation (hosted on Hugging Face).
- **Training and Testing Pipelines:** End-to-end training, evaluation, and checkpointing scripts.
- **Analysis Pipelines:** Preliminary analysis code for exploring model performance and interpretability.
